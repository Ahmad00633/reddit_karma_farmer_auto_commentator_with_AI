## Introduction

The Reddit Comment Generator is a Python script designed to automatically generate and post comments on Reddit. By analyzing trending subreddits and top posts, the script creates engaging comments tailored to maximize interaction and upvotes. It uses OpenAI's GPT models and LangChain to generate content based on specific rules and summaries.

## Features

- **Automatic Reddit Commenting**: Comments are generated and submitted to trending posts.
- **Customizable Content Generation**: Utilizes various comment types such as insightful, humorous, question-oriented, and more.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for comment submission failures, rate limits, and subreddit restrictions.
- **Randomized Comment Intervals**: Avoids detection of automated behavior by introducing random sleep intervals.

## Installation

To set up and use the Reddit Comment Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feder-cr/karma_farmer_auto_commentator_with_AI.git
   cd karma_farmer_auto_commentator_with_AI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### `config_secrets.py`

This file contains your sensitive credentials and API keys. It should be placed in the same directory as your main script. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

```python
CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET'
USERNAME = 'YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME'
PASSWORD = 'YOUR_REDDIT_PASSWORD'
OPENAI_KEY = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
```

  - `CLIENT_ID`: Your Reddit application's client ID.
  - `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Reddit application's client secret.
  - `USERNAME`: Your Reddit username.
  - `PASSWORD`: Your Reddit account password.
  - `OPENAI_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

**Important**: Ensure this file is kept private and not shared or committed to version control to protect your sensitive information.
